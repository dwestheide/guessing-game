# About this project

This is an example application for the case study at the end of my book [Scala from Scratch: Exploration](https://leanpub.com/scala-from-scratch-exploration/).

It's a command-line number guessing game, and it's heavily inspired by [the Rust guessing game tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) that starts the freely available book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and other people â€” one of the best learning resources available for Rust or any programming language.
